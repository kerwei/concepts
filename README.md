# Implementation Practice of Programming Concepts
This repository serves to hold all practice attempts at implementing all sorts of concepts related to programming. Codes will be added as and when I have the chance to or if I come accross something interesting!

Unittest is used to check the correctness of the implementation. While I try to be exhaustive in the testing, there is still a chance that I may have missed something. Hence, even if the implemented function pass all tests, its correctness should still be taken with a grain of salt!

To run the tests, run the following line on the terminal from the root folder:
`python -m unittest tests/test_searches.py`

```
